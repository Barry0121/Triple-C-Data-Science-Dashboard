Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

 for more information. This is a 2 Bedroom, 2 Bath, approximately 1121 Sq. Ft.  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

As you reach upstairs, what would be a 4th bedroom has been opened up to be a den, 2nd family room, office or playroom.  The master bedroom has vaulted ceilings, walk-in closet, and attached master bath w/ dual sinks.  (The master bath is getting a brand new shower installed! Excuse the mess in the pictures this will be completed soon.)  Enjoy the expansive canyon views.  The two other bedroom are both good size and share the hallway bathroom.  Best part of the house could be the HUGE yard!  There is a covered patio space, a playhouse, and a trampoline.  Even with all this you still have lots of extra space for playing or entertaining. All while enjoying the 270 degree canyon views.  Located on at the end of a cul-de-sac in a very low-traffic area, this home is still close to everything Mira Mesa has to offer.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.
