Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

 for more information. This is a 2 Bedroom, 2 Bath, approximately 1121 Sq. Ft.  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

 to contact our team.APEX MISSION VALLEY LUXURY APARTMENTS  This is a 2 Bedroom, 2 Bath, approximately 1121 Sq. Ft.  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

 to text our leasing team.APEX MISSION VALLEY LUXURY APARTMENTS  This is a 2 Bedroom, 2.5 Bath, approximately 1155 Sq. Ft.  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Incredible 4BR/3BA Canyon View home in Mira Mesa.  1st time on the rental market.  Enter this spacious home into the formal living & dining room with 2-story cathedral ceilings.  There is a family room off to the right w/ a fireplace.  Both areas flow into the updated kitchen that comes with all stainless appliances.  Tons of designer cabinets with soft-close doors.  There is a bathroom downstairs, garage access, and the laundry room complete with full-size washer & dyer.  As you reach upstairs, what would be a 4th bedroom has been opened up to be a den, 2nd family room, office or playroom.  The master bedroom has vaulted ceilings, walk-in closet, and attached master bath w/ dual sinks.  (The master bath is getting a brand new shower installed! Excuse the mess in the pictures this will be completed soon.)  Enjoy the expansive canyon views.  The two other bedroom are both good size and share the hallway bathroom.  Best part of the house could be the HUGE yard!  There is a covered patio space, a playhouse, and a trampoline.  Even with all this you still have lots of extra space for playing or entertaining. All while enjoying the 270 degree canyon views.  Located on at the end of a cul-de-sac in a very low-traffic area, this home is still close to everything Mira Mesa has to offer.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

 to chat! This is a 2 Bedroom, 2 Bath, approximately 1121 Sq. Ft.  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.

I’m a 21 year old and I’ll be interning this summer and looking for a place to live within 30 minutes driving to Newport Beach. I currently have 1 friend I’ll be living with but can add up to 3 more if need be. Let me know if you need a lease taken over from June-September or any months in between.

I don’t want to pay more than $850 a month per person in rent. I’m struggling finding places online that offer either subletting for the summer or month to month leases so I’m reaching out on here to see if anyone has openings.

Feel free to shoot me an email or text if you have any questions or availabilities!I am a 32-year-old Ph.D. student at Pacifica Graduate Institute and I am relocating to Santa Barbara to continue my education. I am a clean, respectful, and timely  who enjoys surfing, hiking, playing guitar, reading, cooking, traveling, and hard work. I am handy and am able to fix things on my own for the most part. I'm also willing to do a work trade of sorts if that creates the opportunity for the right living space. Hablo un poco de espanol y practica todo el tiempo. I moving from out of state and am excited to settle into my new home and create a new chapter. I have excellent references, reliable income, and am a great tenant. My goal is to find a place I can stay for many years to come. My budget is $2,000 a month but I can adjust for the right place. I prefer a 1 bedroom home and am not interested in rooms for rent. I would like to move in no later than December 10th. Thank you so much, I look forward to hearing from you!

i am a high school graduate and have been doing many different types of jobs throughout the past 2 years, I am currently residing in Mexico due to health concerns for my grandmother because of the pandemic but I am now ready to move back into the states to continue my education asap and finish college. A little bit about me, i am a certified wine sommelier, and 8 currently work as a tour guide operator for carnival cruises at the port of Ensenada wine country I'm both fluent in English and Spanish and have lived in this area my whole life. I was born and raised here in Mexico but have spent 10 years living in the us before moving back to Mexico 2 years ago. i am a fairly quiet guy and enjoy listening to music as well as playing my acoustic guitar i do wear my headphones when listening to my music so you will not receive any loud noise from me at all, i am also a huge nerd and built my own computer so if you're having any tech difficulties i am more than glad to be of help this includes moving furniture or help moving heavy objects since i am a pretty big and tall guy, i tend to keep to myself a lot but do love meeting people and keeping contact with friends from both the us and Mexico, i really do hope you take the time to read this as i understand its a bit lengthy but if you would like to know more about me feel free to reply to my email, this listing seems perfect for me since it is both affordable and located precisely where i wish to work and start my journey back into the Californian society

Hello and thanks for checking out my ad.

I'm currently looking for an UNFURNISHED master bedroom in Laguna Hills, Aliso Viejo, Irvine, Lake Forest, or Mission Viejo.

About me:

I’m a 60-year-old single  IT professional who has been renting the same room in Laguna Hills for approximately 8 years.

• Excellent credit and rental history.

• Quiet and dependable tenant who pays rent on time.

• Work 5-6 days a week.

• Not a party guy, don't smoke and don't do drugs.

• I'm clean and pick up after myself.

• No drama.


Hoping to find an unfurnished master bedroom for up to $1200.00/mo, including all the utilities.

If I sound like the perfect tenant for you, please get back to me by email. If not, good luck with your search. Thanks!
Hey! My name's Tyler and I'm an artist looking for a place to work / rent. I've been financially independent since 19 (now 23) and I have a psychology degree so I'm somewhat emotionally mature. Very big on cleanliness.

I like to explore the city, read, write, and engage in politics as a leftist. I love breakfast croissants. Graduated from JMU in May but still interested in academia. Currently working two jobs.

Here's the catch i guess, I'm making my second bedroom rock album BUT here's the thing: most instruments are recorded directly to laptop and so the most you would ever hear is acoustic guitar or my lovely singing voice, but I had three roommates during my last album and they said they NEVER noticed and i asked quite a bit because i'm considerate. (Our rooms were really close).

Very helpful roommate and capable of plenty of compromise. If this sounds like it might work text me. My budget is $700-$1,200, but I prefer the lower end haha.

Preferred areas: The Westside, Silver Lake, Echo Park, Venice, Palms, Inglewood, Hollywood, Mid City. My Instagram is Tylerheyok

34/m Human and 3/f Calico cat, Plants
Looking to move to federal hill, move in flexible, preferably before the end of the year.
I work in manufacturing, make good money, have good credit, and references. I have been looking for an affordable 1-2 bedroom in federal hill for a couple months now but most of it is out of my price range, and anything that does pop up is either a scam or scooped up before I even get an email out. I prefer living with people anyways, but none of my reliable friends are in the market for a place right now. I’m hoping to find a spot somewhere between Atwells and Westminister, with cool people in their 20’s-30s that has that old house charm but some modern finishing touches. I have lived with many people over the years and can provide references that will vouch for the fact that I pay on time and pick up after myself. I take care of the cat facilities so it doesn’t smell and I’m not obnoxious. I have Furnature and some household stuff, so I don’t need a furnished room, and I can contribute to the household if you’d like.
I can afford to live elsewhere in providence but have wanted to move to federal hill for years and feel like this is my last chance to get into the city before I settle down and buy a house out in the woods somewhere. (Once the housing bubble bursts, I’d be mad to buy right now anyways)
If your looking to fill a room, or sublet the rest of your lease, please drop me a line. Open to bedrooms in a shared situation, or taking over the lease in an affordable 1-2bed apartment.
Let’s see the possibilities this brings

Hey! My name's Tyler and I'm an artist looking for a place to work / rent. I've been financially independent since 19 (now 23) and I have a psychology degree so I'm somewhat emotionally mature. Very big on cleanliness.

I like to explore the city, read, write, and engage in politics as a leftist. I love breakfast croissants. Graduated from JMU in May but still interested in academia. Currently working two jobs.

Here's the catch i guess, I'm making my second bedroom rock album BUT here's the thing: most instruments are recorded directly to laptop and so the most you would ever hear is acoustic guitar or my lovely singing voice, but I had three roommates during my last album and they said they NEVER noticed and i asked quite a bit because i'm considerate. (Our rooms were really close).

Very helpful roommate and capable of plenty of compromise. If this sounds like it might work text me. My budget is $700-$1,200, but I prefer the lower end haha.

Preferred areas: The Westside, Silver Lake, Echo Park, Venice, Palms, Inglewood, Hollywood, Mid City. My Instagram is Tylerheyok

Looking to move to federal hill, move in flexible, preferably before the end of the year.
I work in manufacturing, make good money, have good credit, and references. I have been looking for an affordable 1-2 bedroom in federal hill for a couple months now but most of it is out of my price range, and anything that does pop up is either a scam or scooped up before I even get an email out. I prefer living with people anyways, but none of my reliable friends are in the market for a place right now. I’m hoping to find a spot somewhere between Atwells and Westminister, with cool people in their 20’s-30s that has that old house charm but some modern finishing touches. I have lived with many people over the years and can provide references that will vouch for the fact that I pay on time and pick up after myself. I take care of the cat facilities so it doesn’t smell and I’m not obnoxious. I have Furnature and some household stuff, so I don’t need a furnished room, and I can contribute to the household if you’d like.
I can afford to live elsewhere in providence but have wanted to move to federal hill for years and feel like this is my last chance to get into the city before I settle down and buy a house out in the woods somewhere. (Once the housing bubble bursts, I’d be mad to buy right now anyways)
If your looking to fill a room, or sublet the rest of your lease, please drop me a line. Open to bedrooms in a shared situation, or taking over the lease in an affordable 1-2bed apartment.
Let’s see the possibilities this brings

 to chat!APEX MISSION VALLEY LUXURY APARTMENTS  This is a 2 Bedroom, 2 Bath, approximately 1121 Sq. Ft.  Apex Mission Valley Apartments is nestled in the heart of Mission Valley— one of San Diego’s most popular and amenity-rich neighborhoods. The property sits directly across the street from the 1.7 million sq. ft. Fashion Valley Mall, San Diego’s highest-grossing upscale lifestyle center, home to over 200 restaurants and shops. Fashion Valley's proximity means residents can walk across the street for a bite to eat at True Foods and catch the latest movie at the AMC Theater or shop at the region’s only Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus before meeting with friends for cocktails at Stacked or the soon-to-open North Italia.Residents are always within walking distance of the lifestyle center, but they’re also just 5 to 15 minutes away from virtually everything else that San Diego has to offer. Visitors come from around the world to vacation on the white sand beaches of La Jolla, dine at the award winning restaurants in Downtown, and chill at the laid back craft breweries in North Park and Hillcrest— it’s no wonder Forbes recently named San Diego the third “Coolest City in the Nation.” With the nearest trolley station located at the other end of the Fashion Valley Mall, residents can do nearly all of this without ever having to set foot in a car.
